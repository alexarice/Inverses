* Start with examples of higher category
** Topological space
** Type
** Cat
** \(\omega\)-cat
* Discuss equality in
** categories
** Cat
** Higher categories
** Introduce quasi-invertibility
* Introduce our notion of higher category
** Motivate string diagrams
** Discuss problem with quasi-invertibility
** Compare to type theory
** Add bi-invertibility and half-adjoint invertibility
* Discuss results
** Give some proofs if time
